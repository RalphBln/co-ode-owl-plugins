<h1>OWL PAttern: Custom Class</h1>

<p>Placeholder - maybe its relatively easy to create a customised editor for a given set of classes</p>

<p>This pattern is any class that has a given annotation on it with a give value.
    These are specified in the constructor of the Pattern descriptor, therefore many different versions
    could be created and registered with the PatternMAnager (currently done in PatternBrowserView class).</p>

<p>Trying to come up with a declarative way of describing patterns is VERY HARD.</p>

<p>Maybe this could be used as a "low-customisation-effort" approach that still requires some programming.</p>

<p>Eventually, the editor could be described declaratively, or created with DnD, but the backend still requires code</p>

<p>This might be really handy for eaily finding TODO or deprecation</p>
