This is a list of the tasks which still need to be completed in order to get the FEDERATION plug-in to work:

 - Refactor the ChangeCapsule out of the server package into an independent module
 - Decouple the OWL-API from the HTTP servlet server
 - Create a way for a new "baseline" to be created on the server for a new ontology
 - Debug the Protege plug-in GUI to make it work nicely
 (- Create a locking version management strategy where the locks ensure referential integrity is preserved, so check-ins and check-outs can be interleaved)
