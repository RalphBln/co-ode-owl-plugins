A view that can be configured to show a set of standard annotation fields for every class/property/individual.
This makes it quicker to annotate as they are always in the same order,
editable inline and easy to navigate through (Ctrl-Tab/Shift-Ctrl-Tab).
Useful when developing in a consortium and some standard metadata set should always be entered.
